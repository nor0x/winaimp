> an ai that generates winamp skins

this is a playground repo where i'm experimenting with generative adversarial networks (GANs),  [SciSharp](https://scisharp.github.io/SciSharp) and the [Winamp Skin Collection](https://archive.org/details/winampskins) and 

### first tests
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nor0x/winaimp/master/art/IMG_186143416846.png)
> these are outputs from early epochs (1-30)

> still need a gpu upgrade for better training


### tools
- [dotnet](dot.net)
- [Keras.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Keras.NET)
- [Numpy.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Numpy.NET)

### todo
 - better plotting
 - non-square inputs
 - generator / discriminator optimizations
 - training in the cloud
 - tests with pre-trained model
